      "predicted": "To design a VPC subnet layout for a 2-tier app (web + database) with minimal internet exposure, consider the following:\n\n* Create a VPC with a custom IP address range [c1].\n* Create two subnets: a public-facing subnet for the web servers and a private-facing subnet for the database servers [c1].\n* The public-facing subnet can be configured with an Internet Gateway (IGW) to allow access to the web servers from the internet [c3].\n* The private-facing subnet should not have an IGW and should only be accessible through the web servers in the public-facing subnet [c1].\n* Use Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) and Security Groups to control access to the subnets and instances [c1].\n* Consider using a NAT Gateway or NAT instance to allow the database servers to access the internet for updates and patches, while keeping them private [c3].\n\nThis design provides minimal internet exposure for the database servers while still allowing access to the web servers from the internet.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these steps or provide more information on VPC design best practices?",
