      "question": "What is the difference between a cloud-based deployment model and an on-premises private cloud model?",
      "expected": "Cloud-based runs in the provider cloud; private cloud on-premises runs in customer facilities using virtualization/resource tools and lacks many cloud benefits.",
      "predicted": "- **Location of resources** – A cloud‑based deployment runs all parts of the application in AWS’s public cloud infrastructure, whereas a private‑cloud (on‑premises) deployment places the compute, storage, and networking resources inside the organization’s own data center or facility [c1].\n\n- **Management and operational model** – In a cloud‑based model AWS owns, operates, and maintains the underlying hardware and many of the supporting services, allowing you to focus on the application itself. In an on‑premises private cloud you use virtualization and resource‑management tools to run workloads locally, but you retain responsibility for operating the hardware and many of the supporting services [c1].\n\n- **Typical benefits** – Cloud‑based deployments provide the full set of cloud‑computing advantages such as rapid scalability, pay‑as‑you‑go pricing, and reduced need for upfront capital investment. Private‑cloud deployments often sacrifice those benefits, offering instead dedicated resources and the ability to keep workloads under direct organizational control [c1].\n\n- **Control and flexibility** – Both models give you control over the workloads you run, but the private cloud gives you tighter control over the underlying infrastructure (e.g., hardware selection, network topology) because it is on‑site, while the cloud‑based model abstracts that layer away in favor of higher‑level services and APIs [c1].\n\n- **Use‑case drivers** – Organizations choose cloud‑based deployments to leverage elasticity, global reach, and managed services, whereas they may opt for an on‑premises private cloud when they need dedicated resources, have strict latency or data‑ residency requirements, or must integrate closely with existing legacy systems [c1].",

      "expected": "They are separate facilities with redundancy, enabling applications to survive failures affecting one data center/AZ.",
      "predicted": "- **Physical separation** – Each Availability Zone (AZ) is made up of one or more discrete data centers that are housed in separate facilities, so a problem affecting one site (e.g., power outage, network issue, natural disaster) does not automatically impact the others [c1].\n\n- **Redundant infrastructure** – Every AZ provides its own redundant power, networking, and connectivity, which means that if the redundant components in one AZ fail, the workload can still run on the independent redundant resources in another AZ [c1].\n\n- **Independent failure domains** – Because AZs are isolated from each other, a failure in a single data center is confined to that AZ’s failure domain, preventing a cascade of failures across the entire region [c1].\n\n- **Higher availability and fault tolerance** – Deploying applications and databases across multiple AZs lets you design architectures that remain operational even when one AZ experiences an outage, achieving higher availability than a deployment that relies on a single data center [c1].\n\n- **Scalability with resilience** – Multiple AZs enable you to scale workloads while maintaining fault tolerance, as you can add capacity in a different AZ without exposing the entire system to a single point of failure [c1].",
